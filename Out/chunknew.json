	"text": ["FOLLOW:", "Plus: Solange, Kendall Jenner, and more pictures from the biggest parties at Paris Fashion Week.", "PARIS Paris Fashion Week doesnt exactly have a central hub  designers choose to show in various venues all over the city  but take a stroll down Saint-Honor, as I did yesterday, and youll see a lot of action. My first stop was Htel Costes for the presentation of Parisian designer Raphalla Ribouds new collection. Riboud makes luxurious sleepwear in the form of silk pajamas  the kind its okay to leave the house in and this season shes expanded her line to include lingerie. She presented soft-cup silk bras and matching underwear in vibrant colors, as well as the finest silk-blend basic briefs. I thought there was room in the market for lingerie that was sensual, but also comfortable, she told the Cut. Indeed. Who would argue with that?", "Farther down the road, the\n         \n          Prada\n         \n         store opened its doors to the third chapter of its series \"Prada the Iconoclasts.\" This season, three costume designers were invited to re-imagine an in-store display featuring the\n         \n          spring-summer 2015 collection\n         \n         , in the New York, London, and Paris stores. In Paris, the task fell to four-time Oscar winner Milena Canonero (\n         \n          The Shining\n         \n         and\n         \n          The Grand Budapest Hotel)\n         \n         who chose to create a mise-en-scne devoted to feng shui philosophy and the four elements: water, fire, earth, and wind  as well her own creative addition, love. The likes of\n         \n          Solange Knowles\n         \n         and\n         \n          Catherine Deneuve\n         \n         dropped by to take in the scene, which featured mannequins in various staged positions  dancing, swinging on a swing, being seduced  while dressed in Prada finery.", "After knocking back a Champagne, I moved on to the launch of jeweler Gaia Repossis new collaboration with fashion mecca Colette. (En route, I passed Mark Ronson on the street looking very dapper in a navy suit, cigarette dangling from his mouth, and Parisian goddess\n         \n          Ines de la Fressange\n         \n         racing for a cab.)I arrived at Colette to the sight of Jeremy Scott dutifully posing for photos to promote the launch of his new book, and earlier that day Jefferson Hack and Charlotte Stockdale had been in to launch the new digitally enhanced March editions of\n         \n          Another\n         \n         magazine and\n         \n          Garage\n         \n         ,respectively.", "Everyone from Karl Lagerfeld to Delphine Arnaultstopped by to show their support; Repossi is, after all, the Cline-clad young gun on Place Vendme whose eponymous fine-jewelry collection has been stocked in Colette since day one.", "The one-off capsule collection she created for this occasion revisits her own recent White Noise collection and her signature style of stacked rings and architectural shapes, but comes in at a more accessible price point. The idea was to do light and easy pieces, something fun, she said. I really wanted to do something to support Sarah [Colettes owner]. Colette is so dynamic in Paris  its the door to what is happening next in Paris.", "Ask The Cut", "How to Rebound From the Worst Haircut Ever", "What 10 Nude Athletes Can Teach You About Loving Your Body", "Can We Just, Like, Get Over the Way Women Talk?", "A Helpful Refresher on Cultural Appropriation, in Honor of Kylie Jenners Cornrows", "25 Famous Women on Childlessness", "The Power of 29: An Ode to Being Almost 30", "11 Things I Quit to Get Financially Healthy", "4 People, 650 Square Feet: A Love Story", "Behold the Success of My Eyebrow Wonder Drug", "Astrology GIFs for the Week of July 13, 2015", "Could This Technology Make Condoms Obsolete?", "Refinery29", "HuffPost Parents", "College Fashion", "HuffPost Women", "powered by\n       \n        PubExchange", "A male reporter stupidly asked Williams and other players if they felt insecure about their strong physiques.", "Not just one or two colors.", "I am so proud of these little hairs my face has made.", "No boat needed.", "But \"not because I thought it was bad,\" he clarified.", "Hiding in plain sight.", "That could be changing soon, though.", "Giving props to every player\n        \n        .", "We went, we touched the feathers, we tell you what you need to know.", "Members of Congress: They're just like us!", "So many textures.", "That's what you get for staying at Capri.", "Access denied.", "Researchers can predict which embryos will be healthiest several days sooner.", "The Nobel Peace Prizewinning activist spent the day with Syrian refugees in Lebanon.", "Thirty years of the singer's style compiled in one book.", "Courtesy of wise teen Amandla Stenberg.", "A clip from David Thorpe's\n         \n          Do I Sound Gay?", "Roaming the streets of Chelsea.", "Mirrors galore.", "Let your freak flag fly.", "Against prescriptive fashion recommendations.", "My school actually doesnt do that stuff, but if they did, I would be.

It was more than I had expected, which honestly was nothing. I wasnt really sure how to react because in the space of a few seconds I went from not having seen my family in years to having them all around me.", "My niece Courtney went through a large growth spurt while I was away and looks totally different. My grandmother had a health scare the previous month and I was glad to be able to see her again. My parents seem the same as they ever were.", "Ive been trying to figure out why I didnt suffer from any reverse culture shock, and Ive narrowed it down to a few things:", "Home", "As Ive been in Appleton putting off writing this post, I began to see my hometown with a brand new set of eyes. While this is the city I was born and raised, I havent really lived here in over 15 years. This is the longest stretch Ive spent in the area since I graduated from college.", "I was at a restaurant working on my photos with my laptop and the waitress was looking at my photos and asked me what I was doing. I gave her the 10 second version of the story about how I traveled around the world, and she asked me something rather unexpected: what would you take photos of in Wisconsin?. I had to think about it for a moment. I know this area like the back of my hand, but unlike anyplace I visit, I had to honestly think about what I would try photograph if I was trying to capture the essence of Wisconsin.", "This started the process of trying to look at my hometown in the same way I looked at places around world that I visited. There are a significant number of people who live inside of Angkor in Cambodia. Their home is next to some of the most fantastic ruins in the world. To them it isnt a big deal. It is something they have seen every day of their life. I began to realize just how exotic the mundane parts of life in Wisconsin would be to people from somewhere else.", "My dad and my brother are both big into hunting and fishing. Staple foods at my parents house are venison, walleye, bratwurst and white bass.  In August now, it is common to find sweet corn being sold at the side of the road for $3 a dozen.  At a gas station near an Indian Casino I purchased a big bag of cheese curds for a similar amount.", "These foods were things I never once ate anywhere else in the world. In fact, other than a package of Johnsonville brats I saw in Taipei (because I went out of my way to look for them) I didnt even see any of those foods anywhere else. In fact, I rarely see these things for sale anywhere in the United States outside of the Upper Midwest. (note: the venison and fish arent sold in stores. You have to get that yourself.) The devotion for the Packers is something I have only seen one other place in the world: the devotion New Zealand has for the\n        \n         All Blacks\n        \n        .", "I was also reminded of the times I spent in the Pacific describing to the locals, people who have never in the life seen snow, how ice fishing works, or the time I explained to someone in Vietnam the concept of the snowmobile. I jumped at the chance to eat spring rolls in Saigon, and the locals shrugged their shoulders. As Jerry Seinfeld once said, What do they call Chinese food in China? Food.", "What Ive learned from my time back in Wisconsin is that everything is exotic and nothing is exotic. What is normal to one person is bizarre and fantastic to another.", "Traveling around the world just helps you realize it.", "Categories:\n        \n         Travel\n        \n        |\n        \n         23 Comments", "Traveling around the world  really helps us to realize the life. Thanks", "Welcome back  besides reverse culture shock, another experience i had was physical shock e.g. I returned from a temperate part of the world  Sweden to a tropical part  sunny Singapore.. i couldnt adapt to the weather and temperature!", "When I started reading your blog a month or two ago, I didnt even realize you were from Appleton  I grew up (and currently live) in Cedarburg! Small world.\n          \n          My family and I have been talking about the same question  what is Wisconsin?  so we could make an introductory video for a family reunion. Other items on our list off the top of my head: deep fried everything, beer, mostly flat land, cows (including large cow statues), farms, john deer, harleys.", "I know just what you mean about trying to find ones own hometown exotic after being away for a while. I lived in China for a year, and didnt have a hard time adjusting when I returned to the US. And I was happy to find that although my US audience (who had eagerly read my newsletters about China) was gone, a Chinese friend of mine is happy to hear about the mundane details of my life back home.", "Hey Gary,\n          \n          Hello from an old friend. Remember me from our days at Sacred Heart? My sister sent me a message about your lecture in Appleton and I found your blog. Been catching up on some of your travels. All I can say is Impressive.\n          \n          Drop me a line when you get a chance and well catch up.\n          \n          Greg Bird\n          \n\n           birdman@tmcvoice.com", "Happy Birthday, Gary!!  Glad youre getting to be home for a while, Man of the World.", "Hey Gary. Indeed we all have undiscovered treasure in our backyard.  In my work with the tourism industry the core lesson from your journey is the single most important item for those in the biz to understand.  What is special and unique about your location?  Sometimes, like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, we need to go a long long way to discover there is no place like home and indeed there is treasure in our own backyard.", "Gary, You may think this funny  but Wisconsin is one of the states that Patrick and I have always wanted to go to.  Years ago, we saw a FoodTV special on the cheeses of Wisconsin including tours of the cheesemakers locations, and finding fresh cheese curds, and since then, we have always talked about heading up there.  So, for us, Wisconsin is unique and foreign.", "I think it is completely true that everything and nothing are exotic, all at the same time.  I have lived in the Southeast most of my life and am amazed by the things I find in the South that I have never seen elsewhere  from fried pickles (delicious) to acres and acres of cotton fields to people who are unfailingly polite and sweet.  These are the things I know I am going to miss about my home.", "What an adventure and stories you can share with your family and hometown friends! Will you be going back on the road?", "I see where youre coming from. People from all over the world come to visit the Golden Gate Bridge, but it is just another bridge to me as well as to those who commute on it everyday.", "Hey Gary  thanks for your article on Appleton and Wisconsin.", "No matter how many places I visit or live since leaving Appleton at 17, I still think it has a unique subculture (who doesnt love the cheese curds & venison? ya, yu betcha!).", "I think its interesting  that you dont have any signs of reverse culture shock. But youre right  you had frequent culture changes and the time you spent in Europe & the US before getting back home.", "When I left the US for a year, I had major culture shock when I returned. Spending a year in one place immersed in culture & language had a different effect. When I came back to Appleton, I was thinking in another language (Dutch) and for a few days had to translate everything back into English to talk with family & friends. I couldnt eat a lot of foods because they were too spicy or sweet and I was used to bland (theres a reason why there are few Dutch restaurants in the US!). For months, I broke up my day with morning & afternoon tea just because I was so used to the rhythm of how it fit in the day. I stood out because I wore different clothes & had a different hair style than what was normal back home. Within a few months all the remants of the other culture were gone and I was back to being a cheesehead from Appleton.", "Glad to hear youll be on the road again soon and look forward to reading more of your adventures!", "The what would you take a picture of in (insert hometown here) is a good question to ask Ive hosted some CouchSurfers (and Im hosting a few more), and I must see I feel ashamed whenever I cant answer a question about my own city, or if I have no idea what they should see. Its also sad that I only got to visit and look at one of the more touristy places in Manila after being dragged there by a CS guest.", "Which only means I should take time to explore my own backyard. :-)", "Manila?  The most obvious place is Intramuros. I took some great photos of there of some of the churches. If I get back to Manila Im going to visit Batan and Corregidor, which I didnt get to when I was there last time.", "Yeah, Intramuros was the touristy place I was talking about I refer my CS guests there all the time, then feel ashamed when I couldnt tell them what the place was like, or how to get there and even more so when I have to tell them Id never been there!", "Thankfully, one of my CS guests dragged me there, but it was at night, and it was weird getting lost there at night not knowing where to go. Im already planning to explore the place with one of my friends whos going to take me walking on the wall. :-)", "From the colonization of the Philippines by the Spanish, the rape of Manila in WWII by the Japanese, and story of Jose RIzal, it is sort of the history of the whole country in one spot.", "This is my favorite photo from the Intramuros.\n                \n                 http://everythingeverywhere.smugmug.com/Asia/Philippines/7460333_wBv2a#481265000_B2dua-XL-LB", "That photo is absolutely beautiful! There was a wedding inside San Agustin Church when I went there, so I couldnt fully explore it, but it was definitely beautiful.", "Might be going there tomorrow. Im taking the Pasig River Ferry with friends.", "Greetings, fellow Wisconsinite! My hometown is Theresa, about one hour south of Appleton. I have been teaching overseas for 10 years now, with my current position in India. I can relate perfectly to your reflections on being excited about photographing places around the world which we perceive as exotic, while our own places/state where grew up is taken for granted and we dont really its charm. Now that you have been back from a long absence, it will be easier for you to see Wisconsin with fresh eyes  a perfect opportunity to do some photography and highlight some of its beauty and quaintness. I look forward to seeing your always aesthetic photos, this time capturing a bit of my home state. Good luck!", "Melissa is spot on.  I retired from Wisconsin to the deep South.  And I am reasonably well (world) travelled.  Homecomings to Wisconsin excite and inspire me. You dont appreciate intrinsic beauty until you take a step back.", "I love that the waitress asked what youd photograph in Wisconsin. I too tend not to look at home through fresh eyes (Im from the Midwest as well). Thank you for sharing.", "As for reverse culture shock, I think the most serious symptoms occur to those who chronically carry on about how crazy-awesome the rest of the world is they seem to under value their own culture.", "Ill go deep fry some cheese curds now ;)", "I firmly believe that the fried cheese curd and the cheddarwurst are Wisconsins contribution to the world.", "gary  youre right in that there is something to learn and look at everywhere. (our corn is $1.50 at the amish stand down the road). and reverse culture shock is, i think, missing where youve just been. no? great post.", "Hi Gary,", "I have been on the road for 6 weeks now and have been traveling across Scandinavia and the baltics. I can now completely relate to some of your post about blogging and traveling together. I am planning to serialise some of my travels when I am back. You are an inspiration. Keep those posts coming :)", "Thanks for posting this Gary.  Its a testament to the fact that even the most seemingly mundane parts of life should be celebrated.  Nothing is trivial.", "Looks like you found a way to write this post in the end, and I enjoyed reading it and learning a little more about your roots here in the US.", "Here comes a Stumble.  :)", "Your email address will not be published.\n        \n        Required fields are marked\n        \n         *", "*\n        \n\n         Your Name", "*\n        \n\n         Your Email", "Website", "*\n         \n         Comment:", "2015.

	"text": ["De gokkast Spiderman: Attack Of The Green Goblinis n van de nieuwere Marvel gokkasten van softwarefabricant Playtech. De Marvel franchise reeks slots is waanzinnig populair bij online casino spelers en dat komt niet alleen door de opkomst van de superhelden in films. Deze speelautomaat is van een zeer hoge kwaliteit, in alle opzichten.", "Spiderman: Attack Of The Green Goblin ziet er erg mooi uit: een schitterende sfeervolle intro en een prachtige getekende stijl. Verder is alles bijzonder scherp en kleurrijk, net als in de gelijknamige strips. Het spel ademt sfeer uit. Ook de bonusspelen (die ook nog eens vaak vallen) hebben het Playtech keurmerk: inventief en met een beetje geluk heb je een grote uitbetaling te pakken.", "Het basisspel lijkt op het eerste gezicht zonder veel verassingen. 25 lijnen en het Spider symbool is wild. Met de stad op de achtergrond en uiteraard veel symbolen die op de een of andere manier met Spiderman (Spidey voor vrienden) en zijn alter ego Peter Parker te maken hebben. Denk aan cameras, kranten, zijn liefje en natuurlijk zijn grote rivaal The Green Goblin. Het past allemaal perfect in de sfeer en speelt erg lekker weg. Er zitten echter nog twee leuke features verscholen in het basisspel. De Spiderman Wild feature geeft je random n of meerdere extra Wilds. De Spidey Snapshot Feature geeft je tussen de 3x en 10x je inzet.", "Met Drie scattered Spiderman symbolen op rol 1, 2 en 3 win je n van de bonusrondes. Daarnaast zijn er ook nog eens 4 progressieve jackpots te winnen. Deze vallen willekeurig en omdat ze gekoppeld zijn aan andere speelautomaten lopen ze bijzonder snel op. De kleinere varianten vallen dan ook zeer vaak: wees niet verbaasd als je deze zomaar een paar keer wint in een sessie. Nog een leuke vondst: er bestaat een turbo knop die je aan en uit kan zetten, voor als je net wat meer tempo in je spel wilt hebben.", "Er vallen een paar zaken meteen op als wij naar de bonusrondes van Spiderman kijken. Allereerst:Ze vallen erg vaak. Dit is natuurlijk altijd prettig. Ten tweede: Er zijn wel 5 verschillende bonusrondes te winnen die bol staan van de verassende elementen.", "Zo kan je bijvoorbeeld de Rivaling Free Games winnen, waarin je het tegen de Green Goblin opneemt. Hoe beter je het doet, hoe meer gratis spins en hoe hoger de vermenigvuldiger oploopt. Maar ook de City Chase, waarbij je door de stad slingert en onderwijl credits en mini bonussen verzamelt. Top! Playtech laat met Spiderman weer zien waarom ze de koning van de bonusronde worden genoemd (in ieder geval door ons dan). Door de grote verscheidenheid aan bonussen en de inventiviteit hiervan is Spiderman een absoluut genot om te spelen.", "Spiderman: Attack of The Green Goblin is een werkelijke topkast. Prachtig vormgegeven en vol met kleine en grote verassingen. Bonusrondes vallen ook nog eens erg vaak, wat wij natuurlijk graag zien. Een toptitel van Playtech!", "Spidey spelen?

Ive been visiting this amazing city for more than 20 years, and I continue to get pulled back there for so many reasons, not the least of which is music.", "With so many venues in\n       \n        New Orleans\n       \n       , its difficult to know where to start. But with so many venues, you almost cant go wrong, no matter where you land. Use this list to begin your musical adventure in NOLA, but dont be afraid to dig deeper and venture to places unknown. You wont be disappointed.", "Tipitinas", "One of the best known and most beloved music venues in NOLA is Tipitinas. Its a big club that can accommodate about 1,000 people, and it hosts some of the citys (and the worlds) best performers. Everything about Tipitinas oozes a New Orleansvibe. Also, the Tipitina Foundation that has provided millions of dollars of musical instruments to schools in Louisiana. How cool is that?", "This generous spirit goes back to Tipitinas founding in 1977. The place was started by a group of musicians as a place where the revered Professor Longhair could play in his later years. While most people think he named a song for the venue (I did!), the venue was actually named after one of his songs.", "Its iconic. Its wonderful. And its my very favorite place in New Orleans, mostly because of the artists it attracts. No matter how short you stay in town, Tipitina's should not be missed.", "Tipitina's on Napoleon Avenue", "Rock n Bowl", "The Rock n Bowl is all about fun, in a Big Easy kind of way. Under the same roof you can bowl, eat, or dance (probably don't try them all at once).Arrive early for dinner and enjoy not only typical bowling alley fare (burgers and pizza), but also decidedly Louisiana food such as duck nachos, boudi
	 links, and beignets.", "Inside the bar, music dictates the agenda every night. Wednesday is swing night, Thursday is zydeco (my favorite). On both evenings you can take dance lessons before you hit the lanes (or you can, like me, just free-form dance to the music). Theres always live music on Friday and Saturday nights, too.", "Maple Leaf Bar", "I first stumbled upon the Maple Leaf many years ago during Mardi Gras, when Marcia Ball, an American blues singer, was playing. The place was packed, the doors were open, people filled the street, and her boogie-woogie piano music blasted forth. Since then, its always been a place I hold dear.\n       \n\n       I'm not alone, as a host of repeat customers have made the Maple Leaf the longest continually operating music club in New Orleans. Amazingly, the place hosts live performances every single night. In addition to music, you might find poetry readings or fashion shows.", "Viewfinder Tip: New Orleans is always warm. Dress light and carry an umbrella as you never know when you'll encounter a downpour.", "The Maple Leaf has a lineup of regulars on certain nights of the week. One of those recurring acts: The Rebirth Brass Band, which performs every Tuesday night. Other musicians and events fill in throughout the month.\n       \n\n       Because the Maple Leaf and Rock 'n' Bowl are only about 1.5 miles from each other, you could start your night at the latter joint and then head to the Maple Leaf for some late-night music afterward.", "Preservation Hall", "Preservation Hall is a small venue in the French Quarter with three hour-long shows every night. Book your tickets ahead of time; on every occasion that Ive walked by, there are lines well in advance of shows.\n       \n\n       Preservation Hall is for the tried-and-true music fan; performers usually focus on traditional New Orleans jazz. The place has about 100 musicians on their roster and they rotate through them so you wont know whom exactly youll be seeing until right before you go. Whoever you see, it's a sure bet theyll be talented.\n       \n\n       This venue is not far from the\n       \n        Bourbon Orleans\n       \n       , my favorite accommodation in NOLA, located in the heart of the French Quarter.", "New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival\n       \n\n\n       I cant write a post about music in New Orleans without mentioning the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (most commonly called Jazz Fest). Despite its name, this 7-day event, split over two weekends (usually in April and May), is not exclusively about jazz. You also will find artists playing rock, country, pop, samba, Cajun, zydeco, blues, and more.", "Its been too many years since I last attended Jazz Fest, but when I looked at the 2014 lineup (2015 is not yet available), I nearly cried looking at all the artists I missed last year alone. I mean, Bruce Springsteen, Aaron Neville, Zachary Richard, BeauSoleil. Oh, I cant go on.
